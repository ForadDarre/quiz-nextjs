FE:
-   Add Main page (you can select quizes there)
-   Quizzes will be populated on build (use generateStaticParams)
-   When user selects a quiz, we redirect a user to /quiz/{id}
-   On /quiz/{id} (I guess it is a page.tsx file inside the [id] folder) do fetchQuestions and display all the questions
-   Add correct funcionality to the /quiz/{id} page

Containerazation
-   Add all the docker things
